                    Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
                    literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
                    Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked
                    up
                    one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
                    going
                    through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
                    source.
                    Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
                    Malorum"
                    (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise
                    on
                    the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem
                    Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
                    interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by
                    Cicero
                    are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions
                    from
                    the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
